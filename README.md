# TETRIS

I had to start doing it, because I was wondering if I would be able to graduate without having implemented tetris once in my live.

## Demo

## Play

Since the rotation dynamics of the tetris game are very different than I thought they would be, I will need to refactor my code for the 5th time to have it.

By now, the user can just move the blocks around the screen with the keyboard arrows left an right. The down arrow can also be used to bring the block all the way down to the screen.
